					<p>
						Before programming, I worked as a physical therapist 
						assistant (PTA). While working as a PTA in a 
						long-term care facility, I knew that I had a 
						knack for solving problems with the use of 
						exercise prescription and therapy modalities. 
						What I DIDN’T realize was how those problem-
						solving skills would later leak into other 
						areas of my workplace. One day, while I was 
						treating a total-knee replacement patient in the 
						clinic, I ran out to the front entrance of the 
						building to reset the safety alarm because a 
						visitor had tried to exit the building without 
						entering the proper code. A few minutes later, 
						I saw another therapist go out and help someone 
						with the same issue. By the end of the day, I 
						had used my basic knowledge of Microsoft Word 
						and my love for great customer service to post 
						geriatric-friendly, easy-to-follow signs that 
						explained, step-by-step, how to enter and exit 
						the building safely, without tripping the alarm. 
						Visitors were happy because they didn’t get 
						embarrassed from tripping the alarm, my co-workers 
						rejoiced because they didn’t have to leave their 
						patients to reset the alarm, and my boss rejoiced 
						because I helped improve her team’s productivity 
						numbers! And now I’m a student at Lambda School
						and Free Code Camp, continuing my pursuit of 
						learning to solve problems using technology!
